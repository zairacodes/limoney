Welcome to Limoney, the ultimate game app for young entrepreneurs aged 10 to 14 who are eager to learn about business and finance through a fun and interactive experience.

## Overview

Limoney transforms the traditional lemonade stand into an engaging learning platform where users can manage inventory, make strategic investments and enhance their business operations. This app is designed to teach essential skills like budgeting and money management in a playful and educational way. We created Limoney because we believe these skills are crucial for children's development and are often overlooked in traditional education.

## Development Timeline

- **Week 1**: brainstorming project ideas and conducting feasibility studies (including MVP design and spiking)
- **Week 2**: core development and implementation
- **Week 3**: refinement, testing, demo recording and project retrospective

In just three weeks, we immersed ourselves in a new tech stack, including React Native and Firebase, rapidly gaining proficiency. Utilising Agile methodologies, such as regular stand-ups and sprint planning sessions, along with a Kanban board for task management, we ensured smooth progress and clear communication. While we had prior experience with GitHub, our teamwork allowed us to refine our skills in merging changes and managing branches effectively. This collective effort, combined with Agile practices, enhanced our abilities in conflict tracking and resolution, ultimately leading us to thrive in the collaborative environment.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native and Expo**: cross-platform framework for developing iOS and Android apps, ensuring efficient UI design and development
- **Firebase**: back-end services including Firestore for real-time database management and secure user authentication
- **Context API**: utilised within a UserProvider for effective state management across the app
- **Async Storage and NetInfo**: integrated for handling offline data and monitoring network status, ensuring seamless user experience under varying connectivity conditions
